# RD-project
This repository is part of the R&D Workshop class taught in NeuchÃ¢tel in the Spring semester of 2016.
The authors of this project are Simon Jenni and Laurent Hayez. The supervisor of this project is Patrice Leroy.

Goal of the project
-------------------
The main goal of the project was to implement a Matlab toolbox to automate the anaylsis of cylia beating movies.

Requirements/Wishes from supervisor
----------------------------------
- The documentation should be minimal, but with explicit variables names 
- Explain the shape of input parameters.

Implementation
--------------
The implementation contains the following tools.
- Batch processing from a folder and its subfolder or single file
- Import uncompressed 8bit grey scale .avi files
- Potentially smooth the cilia beating "movie" --> method* : customizable 3D kernel.
- After smoothing, implement the processing by pixel or ROI (size multiple of 4x3 pixels)
- Score tissue surface activity (methods : simple descriptive statistics (variance), entropy, or FFT power)
- Save colored image of the surface activity (bounds of color map  defined by a descriptive statistic (using percentiles : PXX/P(100-XX) XX in [0-50] or defining the min/max of the color map using N class maximizing the entropy and then min/max are located --> Class 1 || min || Class 2 .... Class N-1 || max || Class N
- Keep this image as a potential mask for the following of the process.
- Determine the main frequency or the distribution of frequency given the pixel or ROI --> methods : peak detection using autocorrelation, FFT, wavelet transform.
- If tissue shows region having a similar beating frequency, show the phase of the beating frequency

In addition to this, it contains a GUI tool to analyze easily the obtained results. Note that this GUI is just for analysing the results, and not to compute them

Research part
-------------
- Evaluate the effect of ROI size (pixel, 4x3 ROIs, 8x6 ROIs, ... )
- Evaluate the probable shape of the beating pattern on a by "cilia beating movie" basis.
- Short comparison of the methods used.

Other
-----
The folder doc contains all the documentation such as the slides of the presentations, report and worklog.
